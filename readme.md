# !BEFORE STARTING! 
Inside the terminal type: "pip install inputimeout" in order for the game to work.
# Other Notes:
- inputimeout is used by allowing you to specify a timeout.

- Works best inside the VSCode python terminal, issues reported with powershell and gitbash.

- Still needs small maintenance to make sure it runs on all terminals. 

- Currently works on the latest version of Windows. I will test to see if it works on Linux & Apple later.
# Enjoy! ˆ𐃷ˆ
