# !BEFORE STARTING! in the terminal type: "pip install inputimeout" in order for the game to work.
# inputimeout is used by allowing you to specify a timeout.
# Works best inside the VSCode terminal.
# Still needs small maintenance to make sure it runs on all terminals. 
# Currently works on the latest version of Windows. I will test to see if it works on Linux & Apple later.
# Enjoy! ˆ𐃷ˆ
